**Mixed reality** is the merging of **real** and **virtual worlds** to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.

We think of **Mixed reality** as a spectrum from the **physical world** to an **augmented world** to a fully immersive **virtual world** and all the possibilities in between.
